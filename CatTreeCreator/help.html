        4 Tier: Extensions	30<br>
        Extension 1: 1a - 5 points - Use CSS feature not talked about in class: 
        I decided to use CSS variables to make themes. There are theme buttons 
        in the header of every page, so testing is as simple as trying them out! 
        I learned about CSS variables in my summer internship, where I made an 
        HTML, CSS, and JS application.<br><br>
        Extension 2: 1b - 5 points - Make a fancy page background: I made a gradient 
        background for the website. It is visible on every page.<br><br>
        Extension 3: 2b - 5 points - Add a delete row button: I added a delete row 
        button which can be seen and used on the main page. This removes a row from 
        the bottom of the tree. Testing just requires using the application!<br><br>
        Extension 4: 2d - 10 points - Allow drag and drop for file upload: I added 
        the ability to drag and drop to the file picker. The file must be dragged and 
        dropped onto the file picker, but you can simply try dragging and dropping a 
        file to test it!<br><br>
        Extension 5: 3a - 5 points - Make 3+ more components available: I made 3 additional 
        components available for the cat tree: ramp, bed, and toy. These all can 
        be cycled to just the same as the original three are.
    </p>
    <h2 id="css-modifications">CSS Modifications</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Custom Background</h3>
        <p>
            I added a gradient background which can be seen on each page of the application.
        </p>
        <a href="#header"><h3>Custom CSS Header</h3></a>
        <p>
            I made a custom header, available at the top of every page. The CSS styles for 
            this header are available in the common.css file. This header has id "header" 
            in each html file.
        </p>
        <a href="#navigation-bar"><h3>Navigation Bar Background Color</h3></a>
        <p>
            I added a custom background color to the navigation bar. This color also changes 
            to match the selected theme of the application.
        </p>
        <a href="#home-link"><h3>Custom Link Rule</h3></a>
        <p>
            I added custom CSS rules to the a tag, including padding, margins, and hover 
            styles so that the links resemble buttons. This can be seen with many of the 
            headings in this section, or the links in the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <a href="main.html#tree-sim-area"><h3>Main Content Area Border</h3></a>
        <p>
            I added a white border to the simulation area of the main page. This highlights the 
            whole area. This does not change with the theme, as I liked the white best in either 
            case.
        </p>
        <h3>Help Page Headings Font Change</h3>
        <p>
            All of the headings on the help page are Oswald font, which I imported from Google fonts. 
            This import can be found in help.css.
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="program-usage">Program Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Main Page <br><br>
        The main page of this application is a cat tree simulator. The simulator starts 
        by default with a row of empty components. There are 6 component types that the 
        user can cycle through by pressing the buttons in the simulation area. At the top 
        of the simulation area, there are buttons for the user to add a new row, delete a 
        row, undo or redo changes made, reset the simulator, or set the simulator to a 
        preconfigured option. The user can also save to the server from here. When saving 
        is completed, an alert will pop up letting the user know that the tree has been 
        saved. <br><br><br>

        File Management <br><br>
        This application supports one file to be saved on the server at a time, which the 
        user can save to using the "save" button. The server file can then 
        be loaded from the files page. The user can also download the 
        server file, and upload their own JSON cat tree files. The upload 
        functionality works best with downloaded files from the application, 
        as they are guaranteed to be formatted correctly. To upload a file, 
        simply select one using the file picker or drag and drop a JSON file 
        onto the file picker! Then, press the load button and it will load the file 
        which was selected!
